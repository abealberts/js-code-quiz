# JavaScript Code Quiz

A multiple-choice coding quiz featuring a timer, scoring system, highscore board, and some very, very cool questions. 

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This project was created to build a project that could quiz myself on coding knowledge and track my progress as I retake the quiz in the form of a scoreboard. This project solves the issue of a lack of study tools, as I can easily populate more questions into the quiz and use it to refresh myself on topics later down the line.

- In the grand scheme of things, this project became less of a study tool on the user side, and more of an opportunity to explore and understand JavaScript on the developer side. I spent time studying efficient ways to build systems, how those systems interact with each other, and how to build larger code repos that don't become an absolute mess (I think I did an OK job on that last part).

- Throughout building this project, I felt that I greatly increased my understanding of creating elements in JS using stored data and using localstorage. I felt I was able to grasp some fundamentals about building apps dynamically through code, which makes me feel more confident moving forward into more advanced endeavors.

^ Great video to better understand how to efficiently create elements with JS and change 'states'. I borrowed a lot of the base logic for the questions system and integrated the other acceptance criteria into it.
